    "A persons sex and facial features can unfairly determine what type of roles they play in Hollywood Movies, which has a big impact on influencing societal stereotypes. Thus, a classification model will be built to predict a persons role in Hollywood based on their sex, while simultanesouly examining portrayals of sex in popular Hollywood movies and its impact on real-life sexist stereotypes.
